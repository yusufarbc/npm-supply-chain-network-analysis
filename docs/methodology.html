        <h1>Methodology: Topological Risk Analysis and BRS Model</h1>

        <h3>1. Data Collection and Network Modeling</h3>

        <p>The project models the NPM ecosystem as a directed graph:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nodes:</strong> NPM packages.</li>
            <li><strong>Edges:</strong> Inter-package dependencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sampling Strategy</h3>
        <p>Instead of analyzing the entire NPM ecosystem (3M+ packages), a <strong>Combined Sampling Strategy</strong>
            was followed to capture both infrastructural backbone and popular end-user packages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Seed Set:</strong> The top 1,000 packages by <strong>Dependents</strong> (infrastructure) AND
                the top 1,000 packages by <strong>Downloads</strong> (popularity) were selected from
                <code>ecosyste.ms</code>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Merging:</strong> These lists were combined, resulting in ~1,452 unique seed packages.</li>
            <li><strong>Depth Scanning:</strong> The dependency tree of these seeds was scanned up to depth level 7.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Circular dependencies were cleaned and isolated nodes were filtered out.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>As a result, a directed graph of <strong>2,183 nodes</strong> and <strong>5,417 edges</strong> (after full
            traversal) was constructed.</p>

        <h2>2. Centrality Metrics</h2>

        <p>Three fundamental metrics were used to determine the importance of packages within the network:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Metric</th>
                    <th>Definition</th>
                    <th>Risk Context Meaning</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>In-Degree</strong></td>
                    <td>The count of incoming dependencies.</td>
                    <td><strong>Direct Impact Radius:</strong> Indicates popularity and the immediate number of projects
                        affected by a vulnerability ($w=0.30$).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Out-Degree</strong></td>
                    <td>The count of outgoing dependencies.</td>
                    <td><strong>Attack Surface:</strong> A high out-degree suggests an expanded surface for upstream
                        attacks ($w=0.10$).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Betweenness</strong></td>
                    <td>Frequency of the node appearing on shortest paths between others.</td>
                    <td><strong>Bridge Role:</strong> Quantifies the package's role as a network "bridge" controlling
                        information and risk flow ($w=0.35$).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Inverted Clustering</strong></td>
                    <td>$1 - \text{ClusteringCoefficient}$</td>
                    <td><strong>Local Fragility:</strong> Captures structural holes. Nodes bridging distinct clusters
                        without redundant connections pose higher risk ($w=0.15$).</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>3. Behavioral Risk Score (BRS) v3</h2>

        <p>A single metric is insufficient to express complex supply chain risks. Therefore, a <strong>Behavioral Risk
                Score (BRS)</strong> was developed through weighted combination of structural and popularity metrics.
        </p>

        <h3>Normalization</h3>
        <p>Each metric is normalized to the [0,1] range using the Min-Max method. To focus on orders of magnitude rather
            than raw counts, skewed metrics (<strong>Dependents</strong>, <strong>Downloads</strong>,
            <strong>Staleness</strong>) are <strong>Log-Normalized</strong> before scaling:
        </p>

        <div class="math-block">
            x' = [ln(1+x) - min(ln(1+x))] / [max(ln(1+x)) - min(ln(1+x))]
        </div>

        <h3>Formula (Structural Model)</h3>
        <p>The v3 model prioritizes <strong>strategic position</strong> (Betweenness) and <strong>impact radius</strong>
            (In-Degree), while accounting for <strong>local fragility</strong> (Inverted Clustering).</p>

        <div class="math-block">
            BRS = 0.35 · Betweenness' + 0.30 · In-Degree'<br>
            + 0.15 · ClusteringInv' + 0.10 · Out-Degree'<br>
            + 0.05 · Dependents' + 0.05 · Downloads'
        </div>

        <h3>Weight Rationale</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Betweenness (35%):</strong> High weight. Identifies "bridge" packages that connect different
                parts of the ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>In-Degree (30%):</strong> Represents direct impact radius and immediate reach within the graph.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Inverted Clustering (15%):</strong> Penalizes high redundancy; rewards nodes that bridge
                structural holes.</li>
            <li><strong>Out-Degree (10%):</strong> Represents complexity and attack surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependents & Downloads (5% each):</strong> Global popularity metrics given lower weight to
                prioritize hidden structural risks over raw fame.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Robustness and Cascade Analysis</h2>

        <p>The model's validity was tested through <strong>targeted attack simulations</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Packages with high BRS scores are sequentially removed from the network.</li>
            <li>At each step, the network's <strong>Largest Connected Component (LCC)</strong> size is measured.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Targeted attacks using BRS cause an <strong>exponential decay</strong> in
                network connectivity, whereas random attacks show a linear or negligible decline, proving the scale-free
                nature of the network.</li>
        </ul>
